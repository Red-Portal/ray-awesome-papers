    * *A beautifully simple and powerful example of applying probabilistic graphical modeling and variational inference. One of my favorite. This paper completely sold me on probabilistic machine learning.*

    * [Juliacon 2017 Talk](https://juliacomputing.com/case-studies/celeste.html)
    * *An example of applying probabilistic graphical modelling for extremely complex inference problems with variables interacting with each other in complicated ways. Also, the model is unsupervised.*

    * [Stanford Seminar](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwzYNura0Ps)
    * *Shannon communication theory can sometimes be applied in very unexpected places. This paper discusses applying communication theory to circuits with indeterministic, probabilistic transmissions.*

    * *An example where neural networks can integrate tightly with domain-specific theory. In this paper the authors combine compressed sensing, a popular method used in MRI image reconstruction, with a neural network-ish method called reaction-diffusion.*

* Ulyanov, Dmitry, Andrea Vedaldi, and Victor Lempitsky. [**"Deep image prior."**](https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.10925) Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition. 2018. 
    * *Deep image prior (DIP) is one of the recently discovered mysteries in convolutional neural networks (CNN). The paper shows that CNNs inherently have a structural bias towards 'natural images'. However, it only briefly discusses the discovery and provides limited theoretical insight (which makes the DIP an open problem).*
